Game Description
Spooky Mansion Game is a Python-based text adventure where you explore a haunted mansion, collect items, and work towards defeating the formidable Revenant. The game provides the following features:

Multiple rooms to explore within the mansion.
Collection of 8 unique items to defeat Revenant and win the game.
An inventory system to track the items you've collected.
Intriguing and spooky storyline.
Getting Started
To play the game, you'll need Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps to get started:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spooky-mansion-game.git

Change your working directory to the game's folder:
cd spooky-mansion-game

Run the game using Python:
python spooky_mansion_game.py


How to Play
Your adventure begins in the "Grand Foyer."

You can move in four directions: north, south, east, and west. Use commands like "go south" to navigate through the mansion.

Your goal is to collect all 8 items hidden in different rooms to defeat Revenant.

To collect an item, use the "get 'item name'" command. For example, "get flashlight."

Keep track of your inventory to see the items you've collected.

Continue exploring and collecting items until you've gathered all 8.

If you reach the "Attic of Shadows" before collecting all the items, you'll encounter Revenant and lose the game.

If you collect all 8 items, you'll defeat Revenant and win the game.

The game loop will continue until you win or lose.

Game Logic
The game is implemented using Python and consists of a few key components:

A dictionary representing the rooms and items in the mansion.
Functions for validating directions and displaying instructions.
A game loop in the main function where you input your commands.
